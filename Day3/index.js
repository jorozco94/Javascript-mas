/* Challenge 1: Favorite Foods
- Topic: Object Destructuring
1. Edit the faveFoods object so that it contains 
your favorite foods.
2. Destructure the faveFoods object into three consts: 
breakfast, lunch, and supper.
3. Fetch the meals <section> from the DOM.
4. Set the innerHTML content of the meals <section> to a paragraph
that states what your favorite foods are for breakfast, lunch, and supper.
Use a template literal to construct the string.

E.g.
For breakfast, I only like croissants ü•ê. For lunch, I love pasta üçù, 
and for supper I want usually want pizza üçï.

const faveFoods = {
  breakfast: 'breakfast burrito',
  lunch: 'pepperoni pizza',
  supper: 'spicy chicken sandwich'
}



const { breakfast, lunch, supper } = faveFoods;
const mealsSection = document.querySelector("#meals");
mealsSection.innerHTML = `<p>My favorite breakfast is a heaping ${breakfast}. For lunch I love having an entire ${lunch}, and I like to round out supper by having a ${supper}.</p>`
